### Welcome to my page.

Hi, 
I'm Lucas and I like to learn stuff. I really hope (for your sake) that you didn't come here to get inspired by or to steal my code because I'm really mediocre besides some Python knowledge.
Even if you somehow are able to get ahold of it within my hidden repositories, don't say I didn't warn you.

If you have a project worth sharing please do! Knowing that you're looking at my page, you must either know me or be a professional stalker; either way, you'll know how to reach out to me.

Enjoy.
